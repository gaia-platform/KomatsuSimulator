-- Actions
--
-- Gaia rules are executed within a database transaction. If the transaction fail,
-- the rules engine will retry it as many times as specified in the gaia_log.conf
-- (3 times by default). For this reason rules need to be idempotent: their effect
-- on the database must be the same given the same initial database state.
--
-- Idempotency is broken as soon as non-transactional code is mixed with transactional
-- code. Sending ROS messages is an example of non-transactional code. For this reason
-- it is ideal to separate code that deal with the database from the code that deals with
-- external world. You can do this by creating rules which only purpose is to deal with
-- the external world and that are triggered by specific "action" records.
